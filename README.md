[RISC-V](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-risc-v.html#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20benefits%20of,facilitating%20faster%20time%20to%20market.)
## How ro RISC V work on our computer and flow of working
suppose you writen a code in C language, that code could be like sawping and any other and you want to run this code on your machine then how will run. so first compiller convert this code into assembly language, and again assembler convert this code into machine level language (it means zero and one form and then impliment on hardware) and after that show the result 
## so what the role of RISC V architecture
RISC V architecture tell the how c language code will convert into instruction set and its defined whole procsss of execution
